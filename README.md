# SudokuSolver
A Sudoku game solver. The user inputs the numbers that the puzzle gives either through a GUI or the command line, and the program will give a solution to the puzzle.

This project will help me explore more into Java GUI creation, Backtracking, Artificial Inteligence, Model-View-Controller software design, and much more.
